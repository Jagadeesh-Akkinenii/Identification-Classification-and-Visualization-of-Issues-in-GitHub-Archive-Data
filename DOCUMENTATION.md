<h1> Issue Classification and Visualization for Effective Issue Management </h1>

## ABSTRACT

The effective management of issues is crucial for business analysis and software development projects to ensure timely and quality deliverables. In this study, we present an approach for Issue Classification and Visualization to streamline the issue management process. Leveraging data from gharchive.org, a two-hour dataset from January 1, 2015, between 15:00 to 17:00, was utilized for analysis. The primary objective was to identify unique features of the issues and subsequently extract and classify them into three categories: bugs, features, and questions denoted as 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Following the classification, we employed visualization techniques to highlight significant insights and trends within the dataset, with particular emphasis on visualizing the occurrences of bugs, features, and questions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing issue management practices, aiding developers in prioritizing tasks and allocating resources efficiently.

## INTRODUCTION

Effective issue management is vital not only in software development but also across various domains, including business analysis. As part of a data science intern project, this study focuses on "Issue Classification and Visualization for Effective Issue Management," utilizing data sourced from gharchive.org. The dataset spans two hours on January 1, 2015, from 15:00 to 17:00, and aims to identify, classify, and visualize different types of issues.

The primary objective of this research is twofold. Firstly, we aim to leverage machine learning and data analysis techniques to identify unique issue features and subsequently categorize them into three distinct groups: bugs, features, and questions. This classification process forms the foundation for understanding issue distribution and characteristics within the dataset.

Secondly, the study employs data visualization methodologies to present the findings in a clear and insightful manner. By visualizing the occurrences of bugs, features, and questions, this research aims to reveal potential correlations and provide valuable insights for efficient issue prioritization and resolution.

The significance of this project lies in its applicability to both software development and business analysis. By improving issue management practices, we can contribute to smoother project execution and aid in making informed decisions based on issue patterns and trends. This will detail the methods and techniques used in issue classification and visualization, present the results, and discuss their implications, offering practical insights to optimize issue management in diverse domains.

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Software requirements deal with defining software resource requirements and prerequisites that need to be installed on a computer to provide optimal functioning of an application. These requirements or prerequisites are generally not included in the software installation package and need to be installed separately before the software is installed.

### Platform
In computing, a platform describes some sort of framework, either in hardware or software, which allows software to run. Typical platforms include a computer’s architecture, operating system, or programming languages and their runtime libraries.

Operating system is one of the first requirements mentioned when defining system requirements (software). Software may not be compatible with different versions of same line of operating systems, although some measure of backward compatibility is often maintained. For example, most software designed for Microsoft Windows XP does not run on Microsoft Windows 98, although the converse is not always true. Similarly, software designed using newer features of Linux Kernel v2.6 generally does not run or compile properly (or at all) on Linux distributions using Kernel v2.2 or v2.4.

### APIs and drivers
Software making extensive use of special hardware devices, like high-end display adapters, needs special API or newer device drivers. A good example is DirectX, which is a collection of APIs for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming, on Microsoft platforms.

### Web browser
Most web applications and software depending heavily on Internet technologies make use of the default browser installed on system. Microsoft Internet Explorer is a frequent choice of software running on Microsoft Windows, which makes use of ActiveX controls, despite their vulnerabilities.

## THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS PROJECT ARE:
1. Python
2. Dataset from gharchive.org
3. Jupyter Notebook or Azure Databrick/Databricks Community edition
4. Pandas
5. NumPy
6. Matplotlib
7. PySpark

## HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
The most common set of requirements defined by any operating system or software application is the physical computer resources, also known as hardware, A hardware requirements list is often accompanied by a hardware compatibility list (HCL), especially in case of operating systems. An HCL lists tested, compatible, and sometimes incompatible hardware devices for a particular operating system or application. The following sub-sections discuss the various aspects of hardware requirements.

### Architecture
All computer operating systems are designed for a particular computer architecture. Most software applications are limited to particular operating systems running on particular architectures. Although architecture-independent operating systems and applications exist, most need to be recompiled to run on a new architecture. See also a list of common operating systems and their supporting architectures.

### Processing power
The power of the central processing unit (CPU) is a fundamental system requirement for any software. Most software running on x86 architecture define processing power as the model and the clock speed of the CPU. Many other features of a CPU that influence its speed and power, like bus speed, cache, and MIPS are often ignored. This definition of power is often erroneous, as AMD Athlon and Intel Pentium CPUs at similar clock speed often have different throughput speeds. Intel Pentium CPUs have enjoyed a considerable degree of popularity, and are often mentioned in this category.

### Memory
All software, when run, resides in the random access memory (RAM) of a computer. Memory requirements are defined after considering demands of the application, operating system, supporting software and files, and other running processes. Optimal performance of other unrelated software running on a multi-tasking computer system is also considered when defining this requirement.

### Secondary storage
Hard-disk requirements vary, depending on the size of software installation, temporary files created and maintained while installing or running the software, and possible use of swap space (if RAM is insufficient).

### Display adapter
Software requiring a better than average computer graphics display, like graphics editors and high-end games, often define high-end display adapters in the system requirements.

### Peripherals
Some software applications need to make extensive and/or special use of some peripherals, demanding the higher performance or functionality of such peripherals. Such peripherals include CD-ROM drives, keyboards, pointing devices, network devices, etc.

1. Operating System : Windows Only
2. Processor : i5 or above
3. RAM : 4gb or above
4. Storage: HDD or SSD (Min. 50 GB)

## SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT

### Python Language:
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed. Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

Python is a dynamic, high-level, free open source, and interpreted programming language. It supports object-oriented programming as well as procedural-oriented programming. In Python, we don’t need to declare the type of variable because it is a dynamically typed language. For example, x = 10 Here, x can be anything such as String, int, etc.

8. <b>Easy to Debug:</b>  
Excellent information for mistake tracing. You will be able to quickly identify and correct the majority of your program’s issues once you understand how to interpret Python’s error traces. Simply by glancing at the code, you can determine what it is designed to perform.

9. <b>Python is a Portable language:</b>  
Python language is also a portable language. For example, if we have Python code for windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it, we can run this code on any platform.

10. <b>Python is an Integrated language:</b>  
Python is also an Integrated language because we can easily integrate Python with other languages like C, C++, etc. 

11. <b>Interpreted Language:</b>  
Python is an Interpreted Language because Python code is executed line by line at a time. like other languages C, C++, Java, etc. there is no need to compile Python code this makes it easier to debug our code. The source code of Python is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.

12. <b>Large Standard Library:</b>  
Python has a large standard library that provides a rich set of modules and functions so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in Python such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers, etc.

13. <b>Dynamically Typed Language:</b>  
Python is a dynamically-typed language. That means the type (for example- int, double, long, etc.) for a variable is decided at run time not in advance because of this feature we don’t need to specify the type of variable.

14. <b>Frontend and backend development:</b>  
With a new project py script, you can run and write Python codes in HTML with the help of some simple tags <py-script>, <py-env>, etc. This will help you do frontend development work in Python like javascript. Backend is the strong forte of Python it’s extensively used for this work cause of its frameworks like Django and Flask.

15. <b>Allocating Memory Dynamically:</b>  
In Python, the variable data type does not need to be specified. The memory is automatically allocated to a variable at runtime when it is given a value. Developers do not need to write int y = 18 if the integer value 15 is set to y. You may just type y=18.
